<div class="r1"><br><img src="pic/vegan.jpg" alt="pumpkin pancakes Ingredients " height="200px" width="300px" ><br>
  Ingredients<br>
For the French toast:<br>
1 cup (240ml) unsweetened almond or macadamia milk (strained if homemade)<br>
1 ripe medium banana<br>
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, plus more to serve<br>
1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract<br>
1 tablespoon white (or black) chia seeds<br>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>
1⁄4 teaspoon natural salt<br>
8 slices gluten-free sandwich bread<br>
1⁄4 cup (60ml) coconut oil (in liquid form), plus more as needed<br>
For the caramelized bananas:<br>
2 medium bananas, thickly sliced on the diagonal<br>
1⁄4 cup (37g) coconut sugar<br>
1 to 2 tablespoons coconut oil (in liquid form)<br>
Pure maple syrup, to serve<br>
Optional boosters:<br>
1⁄4 cup (60ml) bourbon or rum<br>
2 tablespoons crushed raw pecans or walnuts<br>
1 tablespoon unsweetened dried shredded coconut<br>
<br> </div>
Method<br>
Set the oven to its lowest temperature or the “warm” setting<br>
Make the French toast batter:<br>
Combine the milk, banana, maple syrup, vanilla, chia seeds,<br>
 cinnamon, and salt into your blender and blast on high for about 30 seconds,<br>
  until well combined. Pour the mixture into a large shallow baking dish and let <br>
  rest for about 5 minutes to thicken slightly.<br>
Soak the bread in the batter:<br>
In batches, place slices of the bread in the baking dish and let soak on one side for 8 to 10 seconds. <br>
Flip the slices and let soak for another 8 to 10 seconds, until evenly moistened.<br>
Cook the French toast:<br>
In a medium skillet (that fits two slices of bread) <br>
or on a large griddle (that holds all of the slices) over medium heat,<br>
 warm 1 to 2 tablespoons of coconut oil per two slices of bread. <br>
 (Resist the urge to use less coconut oil, or the bread won’t get crispy.)<br>
Add the bread and fry for 4 to 6 minutes on each side,<br>
 until golden brown and crispy on the edges;<br>
  you may need to add more coconut oil after you flip the bread.<br>
  If cooking in batches, transfer the French toast to a lined baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm,<br>
  and repeat to fry the remaining bread, adding more coconut oil to cook each batch.<br>
While the last pieces of toast are cooking, make the caramelized bananas:<br>
Combine the banana slices and the coconut sugar in a zipper-lock bag, seal,<br>
 and shake to coat evenly. In a skillet over medium-high heat, warm the coconut oil, <br>
 add the coated bananas and the bourbon booster (if using), <br>
 and fry for about 2 minutes on each side until nicely caramelized.<br>
To serve:<br>
Serve two slices of French toast on each plate, <br>
topped with one-quarter of the caramelized bananas, <br>
one-quarter of the crushed nut boosters, and one-quarter of the coconut booster.<br>
 Pass maple syrup at the table.<br>
